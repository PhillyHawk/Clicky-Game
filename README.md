 ## About The Code

 ### Getting Started

 First thing I did was create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app Clicky-game in the command line. Next, I changed into that directory by typing 'cd Clicky-game' in the terminal. After that I typed yarn start to open the app in the browser.

 ### Starting to Code

 Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files. I only had to alter two things in the index.html page: the title of my app and include a Bootstrap CDN link. I either altered or completely changed the rest of the files, adding my own style. The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory.
